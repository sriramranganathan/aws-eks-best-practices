It is responsible for ensuring that your cluster has enough nodes to schedule your pods without wasting resources. It watches for pods that fail to schedule and for nodes that are underutilized. It then simulates the addition or removal of nodes before applying the change to your cluster. The AWS Cloud Provider implementation within Cluster Autoscaler controls the <code>.DesiredReplicas</code> field of your EC2 Auto Scaling Groups.</p> <p></p> <p>This guide will provide a mental model for configuring the Cluster Autoscaler and choosing the best set of tradeoffs to meet your organization\u2019s requirements. While there is no single best configuration, there are a set of configuration options that enable you to trade off performance, scalability, cost, and availability. Additionally, this guide will provide tips and best practices for optimizing your configuration for AWS.</p>"},{"location":"cluster-autoscaling/#glossary","title":"Glossary","text":"<p>The following terminology will be used frequently throughout this document. These terms can have broad meaning, but are limited to the definitions below for the purposes of this document.</p> <p>Scalability refers to how well the Cluster Autoscaler performs as your Kubernetes Cluster increases in number of pods and nodes. As scalability limits are reached, the Cluster Autoscaler\u2019s performance and functionality degrades. As the Cluster Autoscaler exceeds its scalability limits, it may no longer add or remove nodes in your cluster.</p> <p>Performance refers to how quickly the Cluster Autoscaler is able to make and execute scaling decisions. A perfectly performing Cluster Autoscaler would instantly make a decision and trigger a scaling action in response to stimuli, such as a pod becoming unschedulable.</p> <p>Availability means that pods can be scheduled quickly and without disruption. This includes when newly created pods need to be scheduled and when a scaled down node terminates any remaining pods scheduled to it.</p> <p>Cost is determined by the decision behind scale out and scale in events. Resources are wasted if an existing node is underutilized or a new node is added that is too large for incoming pods. Depending on the use case, there can be costs associated with prematurely terminating pods due to an aggressive scale down decision.</p> <p>Node Groups are an abstract Kubernetes concept for a group of nodes within a cluster.  It is not a true Kubernetes resource, but exists as an abstraction in the Cluster Autoscaler, Cluster API, and other components. Nodes within a Node Group share properties like labels and taints, but may consist of multiple Availability Zones or Instance Types.</p> <p>EC2 Auto Scaling Groups can be used as an implementation of Node Groups on EC2. EC2 Auto Scaling Groups are configured to launch instances that automatically join their Kubernetes Clusters and apply labels and taints to their corresponding Node resource in the Kubernetes API.</p> <p>EC2 Managed Node Groups are another implementation of Node Groups on EC2. They abstract away the complexity manually configuring EC2 Autoscaling Scaling Groups and provide additional management features like node version upgrade and graceful node termination.</p>"},{"location":"cluster-autoscaling/#operating-the-cluster-autoscaler","title":"Operating the Cluster Autoscaler","text":"<p>The Cluster Autoscaler is typically installed as a Deployment in your cluster.

Insufficient Capacity Errors will occur when your EC2 Auto Scaling group cannot scale up due to lack of available capacity. Maximizing diversity by selecting many instance families can increase your chance of achieving your desired scale by tapping into many Spot capacity pools, and decrease the impact of Spot Instance interruptions on your cluster availability. Mixed Instance Policies with Spot Instances are a great way to increase diversity without increasing the number of node groups. Keep in mind, if you need guaranteed resources, use On-Demand Instances instead of Spot Instances.</p> <p>It\u2019s critical that all Instance Types have similar resource capacity when configuring Mixed Instance Policies. The autoscaler\u2019s scheduling simulator uses the first InstanceType in the MixedInstancePolicy. If subsequent Instance Types are larger, resources may be wasted after a scale up. If smaller, your pods may fail to schedule on the new instances due to insufficient capacity. For example, M4, M5, M5a, and M5n instances all have similar amounts of CPU and Memory and are great candidates for a MixedInstancePolicy. The EC2 Instance Selector tool can help you identify similar instance types.</p> <p></p> <p>It's recommended to isolate On-Demand and Spot capacity into separate EC2 Auto Scaling groups. This is preferred over using a base capacity strategy because the scheduling properties are fundamentally different. Since Spot Instances be interrupted at any time (when EC2 needs the capacity back), users will often taint their preemptable nodes, requiring an explicit pod toleration to the preemption behavior. These taints result in different scheduling properties for the nodes, so they should be separated into multiple EC2 Auto Scaling Groups.</p> <p>The Cluster Autoscaler has a concept of Expanders, which provide different strategies for selecting which Node Group to scale. The strategy <code>--expander=least-waste</code> is a good general purpose default, and if you're going to use multiple node groups for Spot Instance diversification (as described in the image above), it could help further cost-optimize the node groups by scaling the group which would be best utilized after the scaling activity.</p>"},{"location":"cluster-autoscaling/#prioritizing-a-node-group-asg","title":"Prioritizing a node group / ASG","text":"<p>You may also configure priority based autoscaling by using the Priority expander. <code>--expander=priority</code> enables your cluster to prioritize a node group / ASG, and if it is unable to scale for any reason, it will choose the next node group in the prioritized list.

This significantly impacts deployment latency because many pods will be forced to wait for a node scale up before they can be scheduled. Nodes can take multiple minutes to become available, which can increase pod scheduling latency by an order of magnitude.</p> <p>This can be mitigated using overprovisioning, which trades cost for scheduling latency. Overprovisioning is implemented using temporary pods with negative priority, which occupy space in the cluster. When newly created pods are unschedulable and have higher priority, the temporary pods will be preempted to make room. The temporary pods then become unschedulable, triggering the Cluster Autoscaler to scale out new overprovisioned nodes.</p> <p>There are other less obvious benefits to overprovisioning. Without overprovisioning, one of the side effects of a highly utilized cluster is that pods will make less optimal scheduling decisions using the <code>preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution</code> rule of Pod or Node Affinity. A common use case for this is to separate pods for a highly available application across availability zones using AntiAffinity. Overprovisioning can significantly increase the chance that a node of the correct zone is available.</p> <p>The amount of overprovisioned capacity is a careful business decision for your organization. At its core, it\u2019s a tradeoff between performance and cost. One way to make this decision is to determine your average scale up frequency and divide it by the amount of time it takes to scale up a new node. For example, if on average you require a new node every 30 seconds and EC2 takes 30 seconds to provision a new node, a single node of overprovisioning will ensure that there\u2019s always an extra node available, reducing scheduling latency by 30 seconds at the cost of a single additional EC2 Instance. To improve zonal scheduling decisions, overprovision a number of nodes equal to the number of availability zones in your EC2 Auto Scaling Group to ensure that the scheduler can select the best zone for incoming pods.</p>"},{"location":"cluster-autoscaling/#prevent-scale-down-eviction","title":"Prevent Scale Down Eviction","text":"<p>Some workloads are expensive to evict.

Currently, the following strategies are supported in EKS:  + random - default expander, selects the instance group randomly + most-pods - selects the instance group that schedules the most amount of pods. + least-waste - selects the node group that will have the least idle CPU (if tied, unused memory) after scale-up. This is useful when you have different classes of nodes, for example, high CPU or high memory nodes, and only want to expand those when there are pending pods that need a lot of those resources. + priority - selects the node group that has the highest priority assigned by the user</p> <p>You can use the random placement strategy for the Expander in Cluster Autoscaler, if EC2 Spot instances are being used as worker nodes. This is the default expander, and arbitrarily chooses a node-group when the cluster must scale out. The random expander maximizes your ability to leverage multiple Spot capacity pools. </p> <p>Priority based expander selects an expansion option based on priorities assigned by a user to scaling groups. Sample priorities can be to let Autoscaler first try to scale out a spot instance node group and then, if it cannot, falls back to scaling out an on-demand node group. </p> <p>most-pods based expander is useful when you are using nodeSelector to make sure certain pods land on certain nodes. </p> <p>From the documentation to specify least-waste as the expander type for the Cluster Autoscaling configuration:</p> <pre><code>    spec:\n      containers:\n      - command:\n        - ./cluster-autoscaler\n        - --v=4\n        - --stderrthreshold=info\n        - --cloud-provider=aws\n        - --skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false\n        - --expander=least-waste\n        - --node-group-auto-discovery=asg:tag=k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled,k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/&lt;YOUR CLUSTER NAME&gt;\n        - --balance-similar-node-groups\n        - --skip-nodes-with-system-pods=false\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cost_optimization/cost-effective/#deploy-horizontal-pod-autoscaling-to-automatically-scales-the-number-of-pods-in-a-deployment-replication-controller-or-replica-set-based-on-that-resources-cpu-utilization-or-other-application-related-metrics","title":"Deploy Horizontal Pod Autoscaling to automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment, replication controller, or replica set based on that resource's CPU utilization or other application related metrics","text":"<p>The Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment, replication controller, or replica set based on resource metrics like CPU utilization or with custom metrics support, on some other application-provided metrics.

When you're unsure about which instance types to use, you can run the Amazon ec2-instance-selector to generate a list of instance types that match your compute requirements.

Limits apply to specific provisioners.</p> <p>The snippet below tells Karpenter to only provision a maximum of 1000 CPU cores and 1000Gi of memory. Karpenter will stop adding capacity only when the limit is met or exceeded. When a limit is exceeded the Karpenter controller will write <code>memory resource usage of 1001 exceeds limit of 1000</code> or a similar looking message to the controller\u2019s logs. If you are routing your container logs to CloudWatch logs, you can create a metrics filter to look for specific patterns or terms in your logs and then create a CloudWatch alarm to alert you when your configured metrics threshold is breached.</p> <p>For further information using limits with Karpenter, see Setting Resource Limits in the Karpenter documentation.</p> <pre><code>spec:\nlimits:\nresources:\ncpu: 1000\nmemory: 1000Gi\n</code></pre> <p>If you don\u2019t use limits or constrain the instance types that Karpenter can provision, Karpenter will continue adding compute capacity to your cluster as needed.

Billing alarms allow you to be alerted and proactively notified when the calculated estimated charges in your account(s) exceed a defined threshold. See Setting up an Amazon CloudWatch Billing Alarm to Proactively Monitor Estimated Charges for additional information.</p> <p>You may also want to enable Cost Anomaly Detection which is an AWS Cost Management feature that uses machine learning to continuously monitor your cost and usage to detect unusual spends.

VPC CNI add-on is installed by default when you provision EKS clusters. VPC CNI runs on Kubernetes worker nodes. The VPC CNI add-on consists of the CNI binary and the IP Address Management (ipamd) plugin. The CNI assigns an IP address from the VPC network to a Pod. The ipamd manages AWS Elastic Networking Interfaces (ENIs) to each Kubernetes node and maintains the warm pool of IPs. The VPC CNI provides configuration options for pre-allocation of ENIs and IP addresses for fast Pod startup times. Refer to Amazon VPC CNI for recommended plugin management best practices.</p> <p>Amazon EKS recommends you specify subnets in at least two availability zones when you create a cluster. Amazon VPC CNI allocates IP addresses to Pods from the node subnets. We strongly recommend checking the subnets for available IP addresses. Please consider VPC and Subnet recommendations before deploying EKS clusters. </p> <p>Amazon VPC CNI allocates a warm pool of ENIs and secondary IP addresses from the subnet attached to the node\u2019s primary ENI. This mode of VPC CNI is called the \"secondary IP mode.\" The number of IP addresses and hence the number of Pods (Pod density) is defined by the number of ENIs and the IP address per ENI (limits) as defined by the instance type. The secondary mode is the default and works well for small clusters with smaller instance types. Please consider using prefix mode if you are experiencing pod density challenges. You can also increase the available IP addresses on node for Pods by assigning prefixes to ENIs.</p> <p>Amazon VPC CNI natively integrates with AWS VPC and allows users to apply existing AWS VPC networking and security best practices for building Kubernetes clusters. This includes the ability to use VPC flow logs, VPC routing policies, and security groups for network traffic isolation. By default, the Amazon VPC CNI applies security group associated with the primary ENI on the node to the Pods. Consider enabling security groups for Pods when you would like to assign different network rules for a Pod.</p> <p>By default, VPC CNI assigns IP addresses to Pods from the subnet assigned to the primary ENI of a node. It is common to experience a shortage of IPv4 addresses when running large clusters with thousands of workloads. AWS VPC allows you to extend available IPs by assigning a secondary CIDRs to work around exhaustion of IPv4 CIDR blocks. AWS VPC CNI allows you to use a different subnet CIDR range for Pods. This feature of VPC CNI is called custom networking. You might consider using custom networking to use 100.64.0.0/10 and 198.19.0.0/16 CIDRs (CG-NAT) with EKS. This effectively allows you to create an environment where Pods no longer consume any RFC1918 IP addresses from your VPC.</p> <p>Custom networking is one option to address the IPv4 address exhaustion problem, but it requires operational overhead. We recommend IPv6 clusters over custom networking to resolve this problem. Specifically, we recommend migrating to IPv6 clusters if you have completely exhausted all available IPv4 address space for your VPC. Evaluate your organization\u2019s plans to support IPv6, and consider if investing in IPv6 may have more long-term value. </p> <p>EKS\u2019s support for IPv6 is focused on solving the IP exhaustion problem caused by a limited IPv4 address space. In response to customer issues with IPv4 exhaustion, EKS has prioritized IPv6-only Pods over dual-stack Pods.

This includes the ability for external IPv4 endpoints to access services, and Pods to access external IPv4 addresses. </p> <p>Amazon EKS IPv6 support leverages native VPC IPv6 capabilities. Each VPC is given an IPv4 address prefix (CIDR block size can be from /16 to /28) and a unique /56 IPv6 address prefix (fixed) from within Amazon\u2019s GUA (Global Unicast Address); you can assign a /64 address prefix to each subnet in your VPC. IPv4 features, like Route Tables, Network Access Control Lists, Peering, and DNS resolution, work the same way in an IPv6 enabled VPC.</p> <p>In the IPv6 world, every address is internet routable. By default, VPC allocates IPv6 CIDR from the public GUA range. VPCs do not support assigning private IPv6 addresses from the Unique Local Address (ULA) range as defined by RFC 4193 (fd00::/8 or fc00::/8). This is true even when you would like to assign an IPv6 CIDR owned by you. Private subnets are supported by implementing an egress-only internet gateway (EIGW) in a VPC, allowing outbound traffic while blocking all incoming traffic. Best practices for implementing IPv6 subnets can be found in the VPC user guide.</p> <p>In an IPv6 EKS cluster, nodes and Pods receive public IPv6 addresses.

Since IPv6 prefix assignment occurs at the node startup, it reduces the risk of getting throttled substantially while increases the performance significantly, especially in large clusters. You will not be required to update any of the warm pool variables as a single IPv6 prefix has many addresses (/80 =&gt; ~10^14 addresses per ENI) and is big enough to support very large clusters. </p> <p></p> <p>Every node gets both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, along with corresponding DNS entries. For a given node, only a single IPv4 address from the VPC address range is consumed. EKS support for IPv6 enables you to communicate with IPv4 endpoints (AWS, on-premise, internet) through a highly opinionated egress-only IPv4 model. EKS implements a host-local CNI plugin, secondary to the VPC CNI plugin, which allocates and configures a IPv4 address for a Pod. The CNI plugin configures a host-specific non-routable IPv4 address for a Pod from the 169.254.172.0/22 range.

Pod\u2019s node-only unique IPv4 address is translated through network address translation (NAT) to the IPv4 (VPC) address of the primary network interface attached to the node. The private IPv4 address of a node is translated by an AWS NAT gateway to the public IPv4 address of the gateway and routed to and from the internet by an AWS internet gateway, as shown in the following picture.</p> <p></p> <p>Any Pod-to-Pod communication across the nodes always uses an IPv6 address.

Multiple types of security rules, such as Pod-to-Pod and Pod-to-External AWS services, can be defined in a single place with EC2 security groups and applied to workloads with Kubernetes native APIs. The image below shows security groups applied at the Pod level and how they simplify your application deployment and node architecture.

To manage trunk interfaces, you must add the <code>AmazonEKSVPCResourceController</code> managed policy to the cluster role that goes with your Amazon EKS cluster.</p> <p>The controller also creates branch interfaces named \"aws-k8s-branch-eni\" and associates them with the trunk interface. Pods are assigned a security group using the SecurityGroupPolicy custom resource and are associated with a branch interface.

You can optionally associate multiple IPv4 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks and multiple IPv6 CIDR blocks to your VPC. When you create a VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the VPC from the private IPv4 address ranges as specified in RFC 1918. The allowed block size is between a <code>/16</code> prefix (65,536 IP addresses) and <code>/28</code> prefix (16 IP addresses). </p> <p>When creating a new VPC, you can attach a single IPv6 CIDR block, and up to five when changing an existing VPC. The prefix length of the CIDR block is fixed at /64 for IPv6 VPCs, which has more than one trillion IP addresses. You can request an IPv6 CIDR block from the pool of IPv6 addresses maintained by Amazon.</p> <p>Amazon EKS clusters support both IPv4 and IPv6. By default, EKS clusters use IPv4 IP. Specifying IPv6 at cluster creation time will enable the use IPv6 clusters. IPv6 clusters require dual-stack VPCs and subnets.</p> <p>Amazon EKS recommends you use at least two subnets that are in different Availability Zones during cluster creation. The subnets you pass in during cluster creation are known as cluster subnets. When you create a cluster, Amazon EKS creates up to 4 cross account (x-account or x-ENIs) ENIs in the subnets that you specify. The x-ENIs are always deployed and are used for cluster administration traffic such as log delivery, exec, and proxy. Please refer to the EKS user guide for complete VPC and subnet requirement details. </p> <p>Kubernetes worker nodes can run in the cluster subnets, but it is not recommended. You can create new subnets dedicated to run nodes and any Kubernetes resources. Nodes can run in either a public or a private subnet. Whether a subnet is public or private refers to whether traffic within the subnet is routed through an internet gateway. Public subnets have a route table entry to the internet through the internet gateway, but private subnets don't.</p> <p>The traffic that originates somewhere else and reaches your nodes is called ingress. Traffic that originates from the nodes and leaves the network is called egress. Nodes with public or elastic IP addresses (EIPs) within a subnet configured with an internet gateway allow ingress from outside of the VPC. Private subnets usually include a NAT gateway, which only allows ingress traffic to the nodes from within the VPC while still allowing traffic from the nodes to leave the VPC (egress).</p> <p>In the IPv6 world, every address is internet routable. The IPv6 addresses associated with the nodes and pods are public. Private subnets are supported by implementing an egress-only internet gateways (EIGW) in a VPC, allowing outbound traffic while blocking all incoming traffic.

The CNI plugin allows Kubernetes Pods to have the same IP address as they do on the VPC network. More specifically, all containers inside the Pod share a network namespace, and they can communicate with each-other using local ports. </p> <p>Amazon VPC CNI has two components:</p> <ul> <li>CNI Binary, which will setup Pod network to enable Pod-to-Pod communication. The CNI binary runs on a node root file system and is invoked by the kubelet when a new Pod gets added to, or an existing Pod removed from the node. </li> <li>ipamd, a long-running node-local IP Address Management (IPAM) daemon and is responsible for:<ul> <li>managing ENIs on a node, and </li> <li>maintaining a warm-pool of available IP addresses or prefix </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>When an instance is created, EC2 creates and attaches a primary ENI associated with a primary subnet. The primary subnet may be public or private. The Pods that run in hostNetwork mode use the primary IP address assigned to the node primary ENI and share the same network namespace as the host.</p> <p>The CNI plugin manages Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) on the node. When a node is provisioned, the CNI plugin automatically allocates a pool of slots (IPs or Prefix\u2019s) from the node\u2019s subnet to the primary ENI. This pool is known as the warm pool, and its size is determined by the node\u2019s instance type. Depending on CNI settings, a slot may be an IP address or a prefix. When a slot on an ENI has been assigned, the CNI may attach additional ENIs with warm pool of slots to the nodes. These additional ENIs are called Secondary ENIs. Each ENI can only support a certain number of slots, based on instance type. The CNI attaches more ENIs to instances based on the number of slots needed, which usually corresponds to the number of Pods. This process continues until the node can no longer support additional ENI. The CNI also pre-allocates \u201cwarm\u201d ENIs and slots for faster Pod startup. Note each instance type has a maximum number of ENIs that may be attached. This is one constraint on Pod density (number of Pods per node), in addition to compute resources. </p> <p></p> <p>The maximum number of network interfaces, and the maximum number of slots that you can use varies by the type of EC2 Instance. Since each Pod consumes an IP address on a slot, the number of Pods you can run on a particular EC2 Instance depends on how many ENIs can be attached to it and how many slots each ENI supports. We suggest setting the maximum Pods per EKS user guide to avoid exhaustion of the instance\u2019s CPU and memory resources. Pods using <code>hostNetwork</code> are excluded from this calculation. You may consider using a script called max-pod-calculator.sh to calculate EKS\u2019s recommended maximum Pods for a given instance type.</p>"},{"location":"networking/vpc-cni/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Secondary IP mode is the default mode for VPC CNI. This guide provides a generic overview of VPC CNI behavior when Secondary IP mode is enabled. The functionality of ipamd (allocation of IP addresses) may vary depending on the configuration settings for VPC CNI, such as Prefix Mode, Security Groups Per Pod, and Custom Networking. </p> <p>The Amazon VPC CNI is deployed as a Kubernetes Daemonset named aws-node on worker nodes. When a worker node is provisioned, it has a default ENI, called the primary ENI, attached to it. The CNI allocates a warm pool of ENIs and secondary IP addresses from the subnet attached to the node\u2019s primary ENI. By default, ipamd attempts to allocate an additional ENI to the node. The IPAMD allocates additional ENI when a single Pod is scheduled and assigned a secondary IP address from the primary ENI. This \"warm\" ENI enables faster Pod networking. As the pool of secondary IP addresses runs out, the CNI adds another ENI to assign more.</p> <p>The number of ENIs and IP addresses in a pool are configured through environment variables called WARM_ENI_TARGET, WARM_IP_TARGET, MINIMUM_IP_TARGET. The <code>aws-node</code> Daemonset will periodically check that a sufficient number of ENIs are attached. A sufficient number of ENIs are attached when all of the <code>WARM_ENI_TARGET</code>, or <code>WARM_IP_TARGET</code> and <code>MINIMUM_IP_TARGET</code> conditions are met. If there are insufficient ENIs attached, the CNI will make an API call to EC2 to attach more until <code>MAX_ENI</code> limit is reached.</p> <ul> <li><code>WARM_ENI_TARGET</code> - Integer, Values &gt;0 indicate requirement Enabled<ul> <li>The number of Warm ENIs to be maintained. An ENI is \u201cwarm\u201d when it is attached as a secondary ENI to a node, but it is not in use by any Pod. More specifically, no IP addresses of the ENI have been associated with a Pod. </li> <li>Example: Consider an instance with 2 ENIs, each ENI supporting 5 IP addresses. WARM_ENI_TARGET is set to 1. If exactly 5 IP addresses are associated with the instance, the CNI maintains 2 ENIs attached to the instance. The first ENI is in use, and all 5 possible IP addresses of this ENI are used. The second ENI is \u201cwarm\u201d with all 5 IP addresses in pool. If another Pod is launched on the instance, a 6th IP address will be needed. The CNI will assign this 6th Pod an IP address from the second ENI and from 5 IPs from the pool. The second ENI is now in use, and no longer in a \u201cwarm\u201d status. The CNI will allocate a 3rd ENI to maintain at least 1 warm ENI. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>The warm ENIs still consume IP addresses from the CIDR of your VPC. IP addresses are \u201cunused\u201d or \u201cwarm\u201d until they are associated with a workload, such as a Pod. </p> <ul> <li><code>WARM_IP_TARGET</code>, Integer, Values &gt;0 indicate requirement Enabled<ul> <li>The number of Warm IP addresses to be maintained. A Warm IP is available on an actively attached ENI, but has not been assigned to a Pod. In other words, the number of Warm IPs available is the number of IPs that may be assigned to a Pod without requiring an additional ENI. </li> <li>Example: Consider an instance with 1 ENI, each ENI supporting 20 IP addresses. WARM_IP_TARGET is set to 5. WARM_ENI_TARGET is set to 0. Only 1 ENI will be attached until a 16th IP address is needed. Then, the CNI will attach a second ENI, consuming 20 possible addresses from the subnet CIDR. </li> </ul> </li> <li><code>MINIMUM_IP_TARGET</code>, Integer, Values &gt;0 indicate requirement Enabled<ul> <li>The minimum number of IP addresses to be allocated at any time. This is commonly used to front-load the assignment of multiple ENIs at instance launch. </li> <li>Example: Consider a newly launched instance. It has 1 ENI and each ENI supports 10 IP addresses. MINIMUM_IP_TARGET is set to 100. The ENI immediately attaches 9 more ENIs for a total of 100 addresses. This happens regardless of any WARM_IP_TARGET or WARM_ENI_TARGET values. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>This project includes a Subnet Calculator Excel Document. This calculator document simulates the IP address consumption of a specified workload under different ENI configuration options, such as <code>WARM_IP_TARGET</code> and <code>WARM_ENI_TARGET</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>When Kubelet receives an add Pod request, the CNI binary queries ipamd for an available IP address, which ipamd then provides to the Pod. The CNI binary wires up the host and Pod network. </p> <p>Pods deployed on a node are, by default, assigned to the same security groups as the primary ENI. Alternatively, Pods may be configured with different security groups.</p> <p></p> <p>As the pool of IP addresses is depleted, the plugin automatically attaches another elastic network interface to the instance and allocates another set of secondary IP addresses to that interface. This process continues until the node can no longer support additional elastic network interfaces.</p> <p></p> <p>When a Pod is deleted, VPC CNI places the Pod\u2019s IP address in a 30-second cool down cache. The IPs in a cool down cache are not assigned to new Pods. When the cooling-off period is over, VPC CNI moves Pod IP back to the warm pool. The cooling-off period prevents Pod IP addresses from being recycled prematurely and allows kube-proxy on all cluster nodes to finish updating the iptables rules. When the number of IPs or ENIs exceeds the number of warm pool settings, the ipamd plugin returns IPs and ENIs to the VPC.</p> <p>As described above in Secondary IP mode, each Pod receives one secondary private IP address from one of the ENIs attached to an instance. Since each Pod uses an IP address, the number of Pods you can run on a particular EC2 Instance depends on how many ENIs can be attached to it and how many IP addresses it supports. The VPC CNI checks the limits file to find out how many ENIs and IP addresses are allowed for each type of instance.</p> <p>You can use the following formula to determine maximum number of Pods you can deploy on a node.</p> <p><code>(Number of network interfaces for the instance type \u00d7 (the number of IP addresses per network interface - 1)) + 2</code></p> <p>The +2 indicates Pods that require host networking, such as kube-proxy and VPC CNI. Amazon EKS requires kube-proxy and VPC CNI to be operating on each node, and these requirements are factored into the max-pods value. If you want to run additional host networking pods, consider updating the max-pods value. </p> <p>The +2 indicates Kubernetes Pods that use host networking, such as kube-proxy and VPC CNI. Amazon EKS requires kube-proxy and VPC CNI to be running on every node and are calculated towards max-pods. Consider updating max-pods if you plan to run more host networking Pods. You can specify <code>--kubelet-extra-args \"\u2014max-pods=110\"</code> as user data in the launch template.</p> <p>As an example, on a cluster with 3 c5.large nodes (3 ENIs and max 10 IPs per ENI), when the cluster starts up and has 2 CoreDNS pods, the CNI will consume 49 IP addresses and keeps them in warm pool. The warm pool enables faster Pod launches when the application is deployed. </p> <p>Node 1 (with CoreDNS pod): 2 ENIs, 20 IPs assigned</p> <p>Node 2 (with CoreDNS pod): 2 ENIs, 20 IPs assigned</p> <p>Node 3 (no Pod): 1 ENI. 10 IPs assigned.</p> <p>Keep in mind that infrastructure pods, often running as daemon sets, each contribute to the max-pod count. These can include:</p> <ul> <li>CoreDNS</li> <li>Amazon Elastic LoadBalancer</li> <li>Operational pods for metrics-server</li> </ul> <p>We suggest that you plan your infrastructure by combining these Pods' capacities.

The following best practices will help you to achieve that.</p>"},{"location":"performance/performance/#recommendations","title":"Recommendations","text":"<ul> <li>Make your container images stateless: A container created with a Docker image should be ephemeral and immutable. In other words, the container should be disposable and independent, i.e. a new one can be built and put in place with absolutely no configuration changes. Design your containers to be stateless. If you would like to use persistent data, use volumes instead. If you would like to store secrets or sensitive application data used by services, you can use solutions like AWS Systems ManagerParameter Store or third-party offerings or open source solutions, such as HashiCorp Valut and Consul, for runtime configurations.</li> <li>Minimal base image : Start with a small base image. Every other instruction in the Dockerfile builds on top of this image. The smaller the base image, the smaller the resulting image is, and the more quickly it can be downloaded. For example, the alpine:3.7 image is 71 MB smaller than the centos:7 image. You can even use the scratch base image, which is an empty image on which you can build your own runtime environment.</li> <li>Avoid unnecessary packages: When building a container image, include only the dependencies what your application needs and avoid installing unnecessary packages. For example if your application does not need an SSH server, don't include one.  This will reduce complexity, dependencies, file sizes, and build times.  To exclude files not relevant to the build use a .dockerignore file.</li> <li>Use multi-stage build:Multi-stage builds allow you to build your application in a first \"build\" container and use the result in another container, while using the same Dockerfile.  To expand a bit on that, in multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don't want in the final image.  This method drastically reduces the size of your final image, without struggling to reduce the number of intermediate layers and files.</li> <li>Minimize number of layers: Each instruction in the Dockerfile adds an extra layer to the Docker image. The number of instructions and layers should be kept to a minimum as this affects build performance and time. For example, the first  instruction below will create multiple layers, whereas the second instruction by using &amp;&amp;(chaining) we reduced the number of layers, which will help provide better performance. The is the best way to reduce the number of layers that will be created in your Dockerfile.</li> <li> <pre><code>        RUN apt-get -y update\n        RUN apt-get install -y python\n        RUN apt-get -y update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y python\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Properly tag your images: When building images, always tag them with useful and meaningful tags. This is a good way to organize and document metadata describing an image, for example, by including a unique counter like build id from a CI server (e.g. CodeBuild or Jenkins) to help with identifying the correct image. The tag latest is used by default if you do not provide one in your Docker commands.  We recommend not to use the automatically created latest tag, because by using this tag you'll automatically be running future major releases, which could include breaking changes for your application. The best practice is to avoid the latest tag and instead use the unique digest created by your CI server.</p> </li> <li>Use Build Cache to improve build speed : The cache allows you to take advantage of existing cached images, rather than building each image from scratch. For example, you should add the source code of your application as late as possible in your Dockerfile so that the base image and your application's dependencies get cached and aren't rebuilt on every build. To reuse already cached images, By default in Amazon EKS, the kubelet will try to pull each image from the specified registry. However, if the imagePullPolicy property of the container is set to IfNotPresent or Never, then a local image is used (preferentially or exclusively, respectively).</li> <li> <p>Image Security : Using public images  may be  a great way to start working on containers and deploying it to Kubernetes. However, using them in production can come with a set of challenges. Especially when it comes to security. Ensure to follow the best practices for packaging and distributing the containers/applications. For example, don't build your containers with passwords baked in also you might need to control what's inside them.  Recommend to use private repository such as Amazon ECR and leverage the in-built image scanning feature to identify software vulnerabilities in your container images.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Right size your containers:  As you develop and run applications in containers, there are a few key areas to consider. How you size containers and manage your application deployments can negatively impact the end-user experience of services that you provide. To help you succeed, the following best practices will help you right size your containers. After you determine the number of resources required for your application, you should set requests and limits Kubernetes to ensure that your applications are running correctly. </p> </li> </ul> <p> (a) Perform testing of the application:  to gather vital statistics and other performance \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based upon this data you can work out the optimal configuration, in terms of memory and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CPU, for your container.

For example, a three tier LAMP application container. Should we keep this application in the same pod? Well, this works effectively as a single pod but this is an example of an anti-pattern for Pod creation. There are two reasons for that </p> <p>(a) If you have both the containers in the same Pod, you are forced to use the same scaling strategy which is not ideal for production environment also you can't effectively manage or constraint resources based on the usage. E.g: you might need to scale just the frontend not frontend and backend (MySQL) as a unit also if you would like to increase the resources dedicated just to the backend, you cant just do that.</p> <p>(b) If you have two separate pods, one for frontend and other for backend. Scaling would be very easy and you get a better reliability.</p> <p>The above might not work in all the use-cases. In the above example frontend and backend may land in different machines and they will communicate with each other via network, So you need to ask the question \"Will my application work correctly, If they are placed and run on different machines?\" If the answer is a \"no\" may be because of the application design or for some other technical reasons, then grouping of containers in a single pod makes sense.

This application should have a single parent process. For example, do not run PHP and MySQL in the same container: it's harder to debug, and you can't horizontally scale the PHP container alone. This separation allows you to better tie the lifecycle of the application to that of the container.  Your containers should be both stateless and immutable. Stateless means that any state (persistent data of any kind) is stored outside of the container, for example, you can use different kinds of external storage like Persistent disk, Amazon EBS, and Amazon EFS if needed, or managed database like Amazon RDS.  Immutable means that a container will not be modified during its life: no updates, no patches, and no configuration changes.

By default, all the running pods have the restart policy set to always which means the kubelet running within a node will automatically restart a pod when the container encounters an error. Health checks extend this capability of kubelet through the concept of container probes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Kubernetes provides two types of health checks: readiness and liveness probes.  For example, consider if one of your applications, which typically runs for long periods of time, transitions to a non-running state and can only recover by being restarted. You can use liveness probes to detect and remedy such situations. Using health checks gives your applications better reliability, and higher uptime.</p> <ul> <li>Advanced Scheduling Techniques: Generally, schedulers ensure that pods are placed only on nodes that have sufficient free resources, and across nodes, they try to balance out the resource utilization across nodes, deployments, replicas, and so on. But sometimes you want to control how your pods are scheduled. For example, perhaps you want to ensure that certain pods are only scheduled on nodes with specialized hardware, such as requiring a GPU machine for an ML workload. Or you want to collocate services that communicate frequently.</li> </ul> <p>Kubernetes offers manyadvanced scheduling featuresand multiple filters/constraints to schedule the pods on the right node.  For example, when using Amazon EKS, you can usetaints and tolerationsto restrict what workloads can run on specific nodes. You can also control pod scheduling using node selectorsandaffinity and anti-affinityconstructs and even have your own custom scheduler built for this purpose.</p>"},{"location":"performance/performance/#scalability-management","title":"Scalability Management","text":"<p>Containers are stateless.

If a system can function consistently and meet demands in spite of changes in its environment over a period of time, it can be called reliable. To achieve this, the system has to detect failures, automatically heal itself, and have the ability to scale based on demand. </p> <p>Customers can use Kubernetes as a foundation to operate mission-critical applications and services reliably. But aside from incorporating container-based application design principles, running workloads reliably also requires a reliable infrastructure. In Kubernetes, infrastructure comprises the control plane and data plane. </p> <p>EKS provides a production-grade Kubernetes control plane that is designed to be highly-available and fault-tolerant. </p> <p>In EKS, AWS is responsible for the reliability of the Kubernetes control plane. EKS runs Kubernetes control plane across three availability zones in an AWS Region. It automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes API servers and the etcd cluster. </p> <p>The responsibility for the data plane\u2019s reliability is shared between you, the customer, and AWS. EKS offers three options for Kubernetes data plane. Fargate, which is the most managed option, handles provisioning and scaling of the data plane. The second option, managed nodes groups, handles provisioning, and updates of the data plane. And finally, self-managed nodes is the least managed option for the data plane. The more AWS-managed data plane you use, the less responsibility you have</p> <p>Managed node groups automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of EC2 nodes. You can use the EKS API (using EKS console, AWS API, AWS CLI, CloudFormation, Terraform, or <code>eksctl</code>),   to create, scale, and upgrade managed nodes. Managed nodes run EKS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instances in your account, and you can install custom software packages by enabling SSH access. When you provision managed nodes, they run as part of an EKS-managed Auto Scaling Group that can span multiple Availability Zones; you control this through the subnets you provide when creating managed nodes. EKS also automatically tags managed nodes so they can be used with Cluster Autoscaler. </p> <p>Amazon EKS follows the shared responsibility model for CVEs and security patches on managed node groups. Because managed nodes run the Amazon EKS-optimized AMIs, Amazon EKS is responsible for building patched versions of these AMIs when bug fixes. However, you are responsible for deploying these patched AMI versions to your managed node groups. </p> <p>EKS also manages updating the nodes although you have to initiate the update process. The process of updating managed node is explained in the EKS documentation. </p> <p>If you run self-managed nodes, you can use Amazon EKS-optimized Linux AMI to create worker nodes. You are responsible for patching and upgrading the AMI and the nodes. It is a best practice to use <code>eksctl</code>, CloudFormation, or infrastructure as code tools to provision self-managed nodes because this will make it easy for you to upgrade self-managed nodes. Consider migrating to new nodes when updating worker nodes because the migration process taints the old node group as <code>NoSchedule</code> and drains the nodes after a new stack is ready to accept the existing pod workload. However, you can also perform an in-place upgrade of self-managed nodes.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This guide includes a set of recommendations that you can use to improve the reliability of your EKS data plane, Kubernetes core components, and your applications.</p>"},{"location":"reliability/docs/#feedback","title":"Feedback","text":"<p>This guide is being released on GitHub to collect direct feedback and suggestions from the broader EKS/Kubernetes community.

This approach works very well when you're trying to ensure fault tolerance as well as availability by having multiple replicas in each of the different topology domains. Pod anti-affinity rules, on the other hand, can easily produce a result where you have a single replica in a topology domain because the pods with an anti-affinity toward each other have a repelling effect. In such cases, a single replica on a dedicated node isn't ideal for fault tolerance nor is it a good use of resources. With topology spread constraints, you have more control over the spread or distribution that the scheduler should try to apply across the topology domains. Here are some important properties to use in this approach: 1. The <code>maxSkew</code> is used to control or determine the maximum point to which things can be uneven across the topology domains. For example, if an application has 10 replicas and is deployed across 3 AZs, you can't get an even spread, but you can influence how uneven the distribution will be. In this case, the <code>maxSkew</code> can be anything between 1 and 10. A value of 1 means you can potentially end up with a spread like <code>4,3,3</code>, <code>3,4,3</code> or <code>3,3,4</code> across the 3 AZs. In contrast, a value of 10 means you can potentially end up with a spread like <code>10,0,0</code>, <code>0,10,0</code> or <code>0,0,10</code> across 3 AZs. 2. The <code>topologyKey</code> is a key for one of the node labels and defines the type of topology domain that should be used for the pod distribution. For example, a zonal spread would have the following key-value pair: <pre><code>topologyKey: \"topology.kubernetes.io/zone\"\n</code></pre> 3. The <code>whenUnsatisfiable</code> property is used to determine how you want the scheduler to respond if the desired constraints can't be satisfied. 4. The <code>labelSelector</code> is used to find matching pods so that the scheduler can be aware of them when deciding where to place pods in accordance with the constraints that you specify.</p> <p>In addition to these above, there are other fields that you can read about further in the Kubernetes documentation.</p> <p></p> <pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: spread-host-az\n  labels:\n    app: web-server\nspec:\n  replicas: 10\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: web-server\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: web-server\n    spec:\n      topologySpreadConstraints:\n      - maxSkew: 1\n        topologyKey: \"topology.kubernetes.io/zone\"\n        whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway\n        labelSelector:\n          matchLabels:\n            app: express-test\n      containers:\n      - name: web-app\n        image: nginx:1.16-alpine\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reliability/docs/application/#run-kubernetes-metrics-server","title":"Run Kubernetes Metrics Server","text":"<p>Install the Kubernetes metrics server to help scale your applications.

When the Pod is terminated, the Python application will be killed abruptly. This can be remediated by changing the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> of the container to launch the Python application. Alternatively, you can use a tool like dumb-init to ensure that your application can handle signals.  </p> <p>You can also use Container hooks to execute a script or an HTTP request at container start or stop. The <code>PreStop</code> hook action runs before the container receives a <code>SIGTERM</code> signal and must complete before this signal is sent.

This node group has three worker nodes spread across three AZs. You have an application that uses an EBS-backed Persistent Volume. When you create this application and the corresponding volume, its Pod gets created in the first of the three AZs. Then, the worker node that runs this Pod becomes unhealthy and subsequently unavailable for use. Cluster Autoscaler will replace the unhealthy node with a new worker node; however, because the autoscaling group spans across three AZs, the new worker node may get launched in the second or the third AZ, but not in the first AZ as the situation demands. As the AZ-constrained EBS volume only exists in the first AZ, but there are no worker nodes available in that AZ, the Pod cannot be scheduled. Therefore, you should create one node group in each AZ, so there is always enough capacity available to run pods that cannot be scheduled in other AZs. </p> <p>Alternatively, EFS can simplify cluster autoscaling when running applications that need persistent storage.

SELinux allows administrators to enforce mandatory access controls (MAC) for every user, application, process, and file.  Think of it as a backstop that restricts the operations that can be performed against to specific resources based on a set of labels.  On EKS, SELinux can be used to prevent containers from accessing each other's resources.</p> <p>Container SELinux policies are defined in the container-selinux package.  Docker CE requires this package (along with its dependencies) so that the processes and files created by Docker (or other container runtimes) run with limited system access. Containers leverage the <code>container_t</code> label which is an alias to <code>svirt_lxc_net_t</code>. These policies effectively prevent containers from accessing certain features of the host.</p> <p>When you configure SELinux for Docker, Docker automatically labels workloads <code>container_t</code> as a type and gives each container a unique MCS level. This will isolate containers from one another. If you need looser restrictions, you can create your own profile in SElinux which grants a container permissions to specific areas of the file system.  This is similar to PSPs in that you can create different profiles for different containers/pods.  For example, you can have a profile for general workloads with a set of restrictive controls and another for things that require privileged access.</p> <p>SELinux for Containers has a set of options that can be configured to modify the default restrictions. The following SELinux Booleans can be enabled or disabled based on your needs:</p> Boolean Default Description <code>container_connect_any</code> <code>off</code> Allow containers to access privileged ports on the host. For example, if you have a container that needs to map ports to 443 or 80 on the host. <code>container_manage_cgroup</code> <code>off</code> Allow containers to manage cgroup configuration. For example, a container running systemd will need this to be enabled. <code>container_use_cephfs</code> <code>off</code> Allow containers to use a ceph file system. <p>By default, containers are allowed to read/execute under <code>/usr</code> and read most content from <code>/etc</code>. The files under <code>/var/lib/docker</code> and <code>/var/lib/containers</code> have the label <code>container_var_lib_t</code>. To view a full list of default, labels see the container.fc file.</p> <pre><code>docker container run -it \\\n-v /var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/repositories.json:/host/repositories.json \\\ncentos:7 cat /host/repositories.json\n# cat: /host/repositories.json: Permission denied\ndocker container run -it \\\n-v /etc/passwd:/host/etc/passwd \\\ncentos:7 cat /host/etc/passwd\n# cat: /host/etc/passwd: Permission denied\n</code></pre> <p>Files labeled with <code>container_file_t</code> are the only files that are writable by containers.

Rather than having Docker automatically relabel the files, you can specify a custom MCS label to run the pod. Volumes that support relabeling will automatically be relabeled so that they are accessible. Pods with a matching MCS label will be able to access the volume. If you need strict isolation, set a different MCS label for each pod.</p> <pre><code>securityContext:\nseLinuxOptions:\n# Provide a unique MCS label per container\n# You can specify user, role, and type also\n# enforcement based on type and level (svert)\nlevel: s0:c144:c154\n</code></pre> <p>In this example <code>s0:c144:c154</code> corresponds to an MCS label assigned to a file that the container is allowed to access.</p> <p>On EKS you could create policies that allow for privileged containers to run, like FluentD and create an SELinux policy to allow it to read from /var/log on the host without needing to relabel the host directory.

A default service account is created automatically for each Namespace within a cluster. When you deploy a pod into a Namespace without referencing a specific service account, the default service account for that Namespace will automatically get assigned to the Pod and the Secret, i.e. the service account (JWT) token for that service account, will get mounted to the pod as a volume at <code>/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount</code>. Decoding the service account token in that directory will reveal the following metadata:  <pre><code>{\n\"iss\": \"kubernetes/serviceaccount\",\n\"kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace\": \"default\",\n\"kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/secret.name\": \"default-token-5pv4z\",\n\"kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-account.name\": \"default\",\n\"kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-account.uid\": \"3b36ddb5-438c-11ea-9438-063a49b60fba\",\n\"sub\": \"system:serviceaccount:default:default\"\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>The default service account has the following permissions to the Kubernetes API. <pre><code>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole\nmetadata:\nannotations:\nrbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: \"true\"\ncreationTimestamp: \"2020-01-30T18:13:25Z\"\nlabels:\nkubernetes.io/bootstrapping: rbac-defaults\nname: system:discovery\nresourceVersion: \"43\"\nselfLink: /apis/rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1/clusterroles/system%3Adiscovery\nuid: 350d2ab8-438c-11ea-9438-063a49b60fba\nrules:\n- nonResourceURLs:\n- /api\n- /api/*\n- /apis\n- /apis/*\n- /healthz\n- /openapi\n- /openapi/*\n- /version\n- /version/\nverbs:\n- get\n</code></pre> This role authorizes unauthenticated and authenticated users to read API information and is deemed safe to be publicly accessible.</p> <p>When an application running within a Pod calls the Kubernetes APIs, the Pod needs to be assigned a service account that explicitly grants it permission to call those APIs.  Similar to guidelines for user access, the Role or ClusterRole bound to a service account should be restricted to the API resources and methods that the application needs to function and nothing else. To use a non-default service account simply set the <code>spec.serviceAccountName</code> field of a Pod to the name of the service account you wish to use. For additional information about creating service accounts, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#service-account-permissions. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>Prior to Kubernetes 1.24, Kubernetes would automatically create a secret for each a service account. This secret was mounted to the pod at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount and would be used by the pod to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server. In Kubernetes 1.24, a service account token is dynamically generated when the pod runs and is only valid for an hour by default. A secret for the service account will not be created. If you have an application that runs outside the cluster that needs to authenticate to the Kubernetes API, e.g. Jenkins, you will need to create a secret of type <code>kubernetes.io/service-account-token</code> along with an annotation that references the service account such as <code>metadata.annotations.kubernetes.io/service-account.name: &lt;SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME&gt;</code>. Secrets created in this way do not expire.</p>"},{"location":"security/docs/iam/#iam-roles-for-service-accounts-irsa","title":"IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)","text":"<p>IRSA is a feature that allows you to assign an IAM role to a Kubernetes service account. It works by leveraging a Kubernetes feature known as Service Account Token Volume Projection. When Pods are configured with a Service Account that references an IAM Role, the Kubernetes API server will call the public OIDC discovery endpoint for the cluster on startup. The endpoint cryptographically signs the OIDC token issued by Kubernetes and the resulting token mounted as a volume. This signed token allows the Pod to call the AWS APIs associated IAM role. When an AWS API is invoked, the AWS SDKs calls <code>sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. After validating the token's signature, IAM exchanges the Kubernetes issued token for a temporary AWS role credential. </p> <p>Decoding the (JWT) token for IRSA will produce output similar to the example you see below:  <pre><code>{\n\"aud\": [\n\"sts.amazonaws.com\"\n],\n\"exp\": 1582306514,\n\"iat\": 1582220114,\n\"iss\": \"https://oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/D43CF17C27A865933144EA99A26FB128\",\n\"kubernetes.io\": {\n\"namespace\": \"default\",\n\"pod\": {\n\"name\": \"alpine-57b5664646-rf966\",\n\"uid\": \"5a20f883-5407-11ea-a85c-0e62b7a4a436\"\n},\n\"serviceaccount\": {\n\"name\": \"s3-read-only\",\n\"uid\": \"a720ba5c-5406-11ea-9438-063a49b60fba\"\n}\n},\n\"nbf\": 1582220114,\n\"sub\": \"system:serviceaccount:default:s3-read-only\"\n}\n</code></pre> This particular token grants the Pod view-only privileges to S3.

Utilizing policy-management tools configured using the Kubernetes Mutating Admission Webhook, policies can be used to mutate the inbound pod specifications.

The listed policies and other examples can been seen in the companion GitHub project for this guide.</p> <p>The result of these two mutations is that pods are attracted to the desired node, while at the same time, not repelled by the specific node taint. To verify this, we can see the snippets of output from two <code>kubectl</code> calls to get the nodes labeled with <code>tenant=tenants-x</code>, and get the pods in the <code>tenants-x</code> namespace.</p> <pre><code>kubectl get nodes -l tenant=tenants-x\nNAME                                        ip-10-0-11-255...\nip-10-0-28-81...\nip-10-0-43-107...\n\nkubectl -n tenants-x get pods -owide\nNAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE\ntenant-test-deploy-58b895ff87-2q7xw   1/1     Running   0          13s   10.0.42.143   ip-10-0-43-107...\ntenant-test-deploy-58b895ff87-9b6hg   1/1     Running   0          13s   10.0.18.145   ip-10-0-28-81...\ntenant-test-deploy-58b895ff87-nxvw5   1/1     Running   0          13s   10.0.30.117   ip-10-0-28-81...\ntenant-test-deploy-58b895ff87-vw796   1/1     Running   0          13s   10.0.3.113    ip-10-0-11-255...\ntenant-test-pod                       1/1     Running   0          13s   10.0.35.83    ip-10-0-43-107...\n</code></pre> <p>As we can see from the above outputs, all the pods are scheduled on the nodes labeled with <code>tenant=tenants-x</code>. Simply put, the pods will only run on the desired nodes, and the other pods (without the required affinity and tolerations) will not. The tenant workloads are effectively isolated.</p> <p>An example mutated pod specification is seen below.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\nname: tenant-test-pod\nnamespace: tenants-x\nspec:\naffinity:\nnodeAffinity:\nrequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\nnodeSelectorTerms:\n- matchExpressions:\n- key: tenant\noperator: In\nvalues:\n- tenants-x\n...\ntolerations:\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: tenant\noperator: Equal\nvalue: tenants-x\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Attention</p> <p>Policy-management tools that are integrated to the Kubernetes API server request flow, using mutating and validating admission webhooks, are designed to respond to the API server's request within a specified timeframe. This is usually 3 seconds or less. If the webhook call fails to return a response within the configured time, the mutation and/or validation of the inbound API sever request may or may not occur. This behavior is based on whether the admission webhook configurations are set to Fail Open or Fail Close.</p> <p>In the above examples, we used policies written for OPA/Gatekeeper. However, there are other policy management tools that handle our node-selection use case as well. For example, this Kyverno policy could be used to handle the node affinity mutation.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>If operating correctly, mutating policies will effect the desired changes to inbound API server request payloads. However, validating policies should also be included to verify that the desired changes occur, before changes are allowed to persist. This is especially important when using these policies for tenant-to-node isolation.

With security groups for pods, you can assign an existing security group to a collection of pods.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>If you reference a security group that does not exist prior to the creation of the pods, the pods will not get scheduled.</p> <p>You can control which pods are assigned to a security group by creating a <code>SecurityGroupPolicy</code> object and specifying a <code>PodSelector</code> or a <code>ServiceAccountSelector</code>. Setting the selectors to <code>{}</code> will assign the SGs referenced in the <code>SecurityGroupPolicy</code> to all pods in a namespace or all Service Accounts in a namespace. Be sure you've familiarized yourself with all the considerations before implementing security groups for pods.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>If you use SGs for pods you must create SGs that allow port 53 outbound to the cluster security group.  Similarly, you must update the cluster security group to accept port 53 inbound traffic from the pod security group.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>The limits for security groups still apply when using security groups for pods so use them judiciously.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>You must create rules for inbound traffic from the cluster security group (kubelet) for all of the probes configured for pod.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>There is a bug that currently prevents the kubelet from communicating with pods that are assigned to SGs. The current workaround involves running <code>sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_early_demux=0</code> on the affected worker nodes.  This is fixed in CNI v1.7.3, https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/releases/tag/v1.7.3.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>Security groups for pods relies on a feature known as ENI trunking which was created to increase the ENI density of an EC2 instance. When a pod is assigned to an SG, a VPC controller associates a branch ENI from the node group with the pod. If there aren't enough branch ENIs available in a node group at the time the pod is scheduled, the pod will stay in pending state. The number of branch ENIs an instance can support varies by instance type/family. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/security-groups-for-pods.html#supported-instance-types for further details.</p> <p>While security groups for pods offers an AWS-native way to control network traffic within and outside of your cluster without the overhead of a policy daemon, other options are available. For example, the Cilium policy engine allows you to reference a DNS name in a network policy. Calico Enterprise includes an option for mapping network policies to AWS security groups. If you've implemented a service mesh like Istio, you can use an egress gateway to restrict network egress to specific, fully qualified domains or IP addresses. For further information about this option, read the three part series on egress traffic control in Istio.</p>"},{"location":"security/docs/network/#encryption-in-transit_1","title":"Encryption in transit","text":"<p>Applications that need to conform to PCI, HIPAA, or other regulations may need to encrypt data while it is in transit.

When a workload starts up with its envoy sidecar proxy, it needs an identity assigned from Istio in order for it to be deemed as trustworthy and allowed to communicate with other services in the mesh.</p> <p>To get this identity from Istio, the <code>istio-agent</code> sends a request known as a certificate signing request (or CSR) to the Istio control plane.

The RA serves as a gatekeeper that makes sure only verified CSR makes it through to the CA. Once the CSR is verified, it will be forwarded to the CA which will then issue a certificate containing a SPIFFE identity with the service account.

This admission controller approach resembles that used in the PAC solutions.</p> <p>According to the Kubernetes documentation, the PSS \"define three different policies to broadly cover the security spectrum. These policies are cumulative and range from highly-permissive to highly-restrictive.\" </p> <p>These policies are defined as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Privileged: Unrestricted (unsecure) policy, providing the widest possible level of permissions. This policy allows for known privilege escalations. It is the absence of a policy. This is good for applications such as logging agents, CNIs, storage drivers, and other system wide applications that need privileged access.</p> </li> <li> <p>Baseline: Minimally restrictive policy which prevents known privilege escalations. Allows the default (minimally specified) Pod configuration. The baseline policy prohibits use of hostNetwork, hostPID, hostIPC, hostPath, hostPort, the inability to add Linux capabilities, along with several other restrictions. </p> </li> <li> <p>Restricted: Heavily restricted policy, following current Pod hardening best practices.  This policy inherits from the baseline and adds further restrictions such as the inability to run as root or a root-group. Restricted policies may impact an application's ability to function. They are primarily targeted at running security critical applications.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These policies define profiles for pod execution, arranged into three levels of privileged vs. restricted access.</p> <p>To implement the controls defined by the PSS, PSA operates in three modes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>enforce: Policy violations will cause the pod to be rejected.</p> </li> <li> <p>audit: Policy violations will trigger the addition of an audit annotation to the event recorded in the audit log, but are otherwise allowed.</p> </li> <li> <p>warn: Policy violations will trigger a user-facing warning, but are otherwise allowed.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These modes and the profile (restriction) levels are configured at the Kubernetes Namespace level, using labels, as seen in the below example.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\nname: policy-test\nlabels:\npod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted\n</code></pre> <p>When used independently, these operational modes have different responses that result in different user experiences.

In this case the Deployment will be applied, while the pod(s) will be prevented from being applied.</p> <p>This is a difficult user experience, as there is no immediate indication that the successfully applied Deployment object belies failed pod creation. The offending podSpecs will not create pods. Inspecting the Deployment resource with <code>kubectl get deploy &lt;DEPLOYMENT_NAME&gt; -oyaml</code> will expose the message from the failed pod(s) <code>.status.conditions</code> element, as seen below.</p> <pre><code>...\nstatus:\nconditions:\n- lastTransitionTime: \"2022-01-20T01:02:08Z\"\nlastUpdateTime: \"2022-01-20T01:02:08Z\"\nmessage: 'pods \"test-688f68dc87-tw587\" is forbidden: violates PodSecurity \"restricted:latest\":\nallowPrivilegeEscalation != false (container \"test\" must set securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation=false),\nunrestricted capabilities (container \"test\" must set securityContext.capabilities.drop=[\"ALL\"]),\nrunAsNonRoot != true (pod or container \"test\" must set securityContext.runAsNonRoot=true),\nseccompProfile (pod or container \"test\" must set securityContext.seccompProfile.type\nto \"RuntimeDefault\" or \"Localhost\")'\nreason: FailedCreate\nstatus: \"True\"\ntype: ReplicaFailure\n...\n</code></pre> <p>In both the audit and warn modes, the pod restrictions do not prevent violating pods from being created and started. However, in these modes audit annotations on API server audit log events and warnings to API server clients, such as kubectl, are triggered, respectively, when pods, as well as objects that create pods, contain podSpecs with violations. A <code>kubectl</code> Warning message is seen below.</p> <pre><code>Warning: would violate PodSecurity \"restricted:latest\": allowPrivilegeEscalation != false (container \"test\" must set securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation=false), unrestricted capabilities (container \"test\" must set securityContext.capabilities.drop=[\"ALL\"]), runAsNonRoot != true (pod or container \"test\" must set securityContext.runAsNonRoot=true), seccompProfile (pod or container \"test\" must set securityContext.seccompProfile.type to \"RuntimeDefault\" or \"Localhost\")\ndeployment.apps/test created\n</code></pre> <p>The PSA audit and warn modes are useful when introducing the PSS without negatively impacting cluster operations.</p> <p>The PSA operational modes are not mutually exclusive, and can be used in a cumulative manner.

While the Linux operating system has a few hundred system calls, the lion's share of them are not necessary for running containers. By restricting what syscalls can be made by a container, you can effectively decrease your application's attack surface.

Prometheus includes away to query using a language called PromQL, which is short for Prometheus Query Language. </p> <p>The high level architecture of Prometheus metrics collection is shown below:</p> <p></p> <p>Prometheus uses a pull mechanism and scrapes metrics from targets using exporters and from the Kubernetes API using the kube state metrics.

You will need to treat the Windows worker pool separate and instead install the Windows exporter on the Windows worker node group. </p> <p>In order to setup Prometheus monitoring for Windows nodes, you need to download and install the WMI exporter on the Windows server itself and then setup the targets inside the scrape configuration of the Prometheus configuration file. The releases page provides all available .msi installers, with respective feature sets and bug fixes. The installer will setup the windows_exporter as a Windows service, as well as create an exception in the Windows firewall. If the installer is run without any parameters, the exporter will run with default settings for enabled collectors, ports, etc.</p> <p>You can check out the scheduling best practices section of this guide which suggests the use of taints/tolerations or RuntimeClass to selectively deploy node exporter only to linux nodes, while the Windows exporter is installed on Windows nodes as you bootstrap the node or using a configuration management tool of your choice (example chef, Ansible, SSM etc).</p> <p>Note that, unlike the linux nodes where the node exporter is installed as a daemonset , on Windows nodes the WMI exporter is installed on the host itself.

This is the recommended way to collect metrics to avoid errors. However, for advanced use the windows_exporter can be passed an optional list of collectors to filter metrics.

Note that PodSecurityPolicy is deprecated as of Kubernetes v1.21, and will be removed in v1.25 and Pod Security Standard (PSS) is the Kubernetes recommended approach for enforcing security going forward.</p> <p>A Pod Security Policy (PSP) is a native solution in Kubernetes to implement security policies. PSP is a cluster-level resource that controls security-sensitive aspects of the Pod specification. Using Pod Security Policy you can define a set of conditions that Pods must meet to be accepted by the cluster. The PSP feature has been available from the early days of Kubernetes and is designed to block misconfigured pods from being created on a given cluster.</p> <p>For more information on Pod Security Policies please reference the Kubernetes documentation. According to the Kubernetes deprecation policy, older versions will stop getting support nine months after the deprecation of the feature.</p> <p>On the other hand, Pod Security Standards (PSS) which is the recommended security approach and typically implemented using Security Contexts are defined as part of the Pod and container specifications in the Pod manifest. PSS is the official standard that the Kubernetes project team has defined to address the security-related best practices for Pods. It defines policies such as baseline (minimally restrictive, default), privileged (unrestrictive) and restricted (most restrictive).</p> <p>We recommend starting with the baseline profile. PSS baseline profile provides a solid balance between security and potential friction, requiring a minimal list of exceptions, it serves as a good starting point for workload security. If you are currently using PSPs we recommend switching to PSS. More details on the PSS policies can be found in the Kubernetes documentation. These policies can be enforced with several tools including those from OPA and Kyverno. For example, Kyverno provides the full collection of PSS policies here.</p> <p>Security context settings allow one to give privileges to select processes, use program profiles to restrict capabilities to individual programs, allow privilege escalation, filter system calls, among other things.</p> <p>Windows pods in Kubernetes have some limitations and differentiators from standard Linux-based workloads when it comes to security contexts.</p> <p>Windows uses a Job object per container with a system namespace filter to contain all processes in a container and provide logical isolation from the host. There is no way to run a Windows container without the namespace filtering in place. This means that system privileges cannot be asserted in the context of the host, and thus privileged containers are not available on Windows.</p> <p>The following <code>windowsOptions</code> are the only documented Windows Security Context options while the rest are general Security Context options</p> <p>For a list of security context attributes that are supported in Windows vs linux, please refer to the official documentation here.</p> <p>The Pod specific settings are applied to all containers. If unspecified, the options from the PodSecurityContext will be used. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.</p> <p>For example, runAsUserName setting for Pods and containers which is a Windows option is a rough equivalent of the Linux-specific runAsUser setting and in the following manifest, the pod specific security context is applied to all containers</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\nname: run-as-username-pod-demo\nspec:\nsecurityContext:\nwindowsOptions:\nrunAsUserName: \"ContainerUser\"\ncontainers:\n- name: run-as-username-demo\n...\nnodeSelector:\nkubernetes.io/os: windows\n</code></pre> <p>Whereas in the following, the container level security context overrides the pod level security context.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\nname: run-as-username-container-demo\nspec:\nsecurityContext:\nwindowsOptions:\nrunAsUserName: \"ContainerUser\"\ncontainers:\n- name: run-as-username-demo\n..\nsecurityContext:\nwindowsOptions:\nrunAsUserName: \"ContainerAdministrator\"\nnodeSelector:\nkubernetes.io/os: windows\n</code></pre> <p>Examples of acceptable values for the runAsUserName field: ContainerAdministrator, ContainerUser, NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE, NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE</p> <p>It is generally a good idea to run your containers with ContainerUser for Windows pods.

You can use the USER directive to do that, like so:</p> <pre><code>USER ContainerAdministrator\nRUN setx /M PATH \"%PATH%;C:/your/path\"\nUSER ContainerUser\n</code></pre> <p>Also note that, secrets are written in clear text on the node's volume (as compared to tmpfs/in-memory on linux).
